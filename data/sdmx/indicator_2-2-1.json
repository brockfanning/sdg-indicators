The numbers and resulting estimate are weighted to be nationally representative.  The 2013-2014 NHANES data were merged with the expanded WHO growth chart files of length/height-for-age for boys and girls by age in days. Age in months at examination on the NHANES 2013-2014 file was converted to age in days by multiplying it by 30.4375 and taking the largest integer of the result.",
