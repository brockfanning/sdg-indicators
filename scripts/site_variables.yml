# The files in this folder are meant to be customized for your needs. The syntax
# used here is YAML, which is the same as the "front matter" used at the top of
# Jekyll content.

# Here you can inform the platform about your particular naming convention in
# CSV files. These settings are case sensitive. For example, if the naming
# convention in your CSV data is to use 'Year' for the year column, you would
# want this setting:
#   year: Year
csv_column_names:
  year:   year
  all:    all
  value:  value

# Here you can inform the scripts about where certain types of files are stored
# in the repository. The paths below are all relative from the root of the repo.
# These paths can be written as Unix-style (using forward-slashes) and the
# scripts will adjust automatically when run on Windows computers.
