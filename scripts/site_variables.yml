# The files in this folder are meant to be customized for your needs. The syntax
# used here is YAML, which is the same as the "front matter" used at the top of
# Jekyll content.

# Here you can inform the platform about your particular naming convention in
# CSV files. These settings are case sensitive. For example, if the naming
# convention in your CSV data is to use 'Year' for the year column, you would
# want this setting:
#   year: Year
csv_column_names:
  year:   year
  all:    all
  value:  value
  unit:   unit

# Here you can inform the scripts about where certain types of files are stored
# in the repository. The paths below are all relative from the root of the repo.
# These paths can be written as Unix-style (using forward-slashes) and the
# scripts will adjust automatically when run on Windows computers.
folders:
  data_csv_wide:      data-wide
  data_csv_tidy:      data
  data_sdmx_json:     data/sdmx
  pages_sdmx:         api/sdmx
  pages_indicators:   _indicators

# Here you can inform the scripts about the keys being used in your indicator's
# "front matter" to control metadata. For example, if the key you are using for
# unit of measure is 'measuring_unit' you would want the following setting:
#   unit_of_measure: measuring_unit
indicator_metadata_keys:
  title:                  title
  method_of_computation:  us_method_of_computation
  data_metadata_updated:  date_metadata_updated
  unit_of_measure:        unit_of_measure

# Here you inform the scripts about how to properly "translate" CSV column names
# into SDMX "concept" IDs. This is case-sensitive. For example, if your
# indicator CSV files tend to use "Age" for CSV columns about age, you might
# want something like this:
#   Age: CL_AGE
# NOTE: This "mapping" can be extended and overridden for each individual
# indicator, by including the same structure in the "front matter" in the
# indicator's .md file in the _indicators folder.
sdmx_concept_columns:
  age: CL_AGE
  sex: CL_SEX

# Here you inform the scripts about how to properly "translate" CSV cells
# (values) into the SDMX "codes" that make up a "code list". These settings are
# case-sensitive. For example, if your indicator CSV files tend to use
# "Female" for the female gender, you might want something like this:
#   Female: F
# NOTE: This "mapping" can be extended and overridden for each individual
# indicator, by including the same structure in the "front matter" in the
# indicator's .md file in the _indicators folder.
sdmx_value_codes:
  female: F
  male: M
